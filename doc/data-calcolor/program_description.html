      <p>
        In this Portfolio class, we provide the mentor-ship, materials, creative environment and support necessary for young students to extend themselves and push outside their comfort zones. At the same time we understand that every artist needs feedback that is honest and helps them move forward. It's our goal to help students become confident with their art and create it thoughtfully and independently. Because we will encourage students to develop artwork which can be defined as "original", many artworks will be eligible to include in student portfolios that are submitted to colleges and art schools.
