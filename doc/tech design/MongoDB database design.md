## Overview
This document describes the details of each collection. Basically, we need following collections:

* users: mainly for login information, Meteor user and account framework will create this collection by default.
* role: to record different roles we have, Meteor Role package will create the form automatically
* swimmers: normal swimmer information, embed class information. Easy for querying, ranking and other swimmer related DB
 operations
* classes: swim class information, refers to swimmers collection, refers to coach information. Easy for DB CRUD
operations from admin side.

## "users" collection
Those accounts who needs login to the system with password should create user login information in this collection.
So far normal account users, coaches and admins need to create user login information in this collection.

NOTE: No separated "coaches" and "admin" collections since they can be covered in this "users" collection

        },
        ...,
    ]
}
```

#### "admin" document
This document should be similar with normal user [Meteor user document](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/meteor_users) but
with admin role.

Every account/coach/admin will create a document in "users" collection when they sign up. The rest part of our App will
use Meteor.userId() to refer to this login information.

## "role" collection
Every user has at least one role. Now we have the following roles: account, coach, admin. We push different message to
different roles.

This collection is to record all the roles we have. It is automatically generated by 'role' package

For APIs, please check [Role Package](https://atmospherejs.com/alanning/roles)

## "swimmers" collection
This collection holds all the information of swimmers.
