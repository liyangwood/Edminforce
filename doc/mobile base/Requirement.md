### Description
1. As discuss with Lan, For this version we can show the avaiable classes in a list. This is an example:

  ![Calendar List](./calendar-list.jpg)

2. Just show the next 2 week avaialbe classes
3. Avaiable Classes condition
  
  * Class is not full. Default.
  * Class trial's max value not reach. Defualt value is 0 

  How to calculate:(as for calcolor school, trial max is 2 for each class which is included in class max. For example, class max is 10, trial max is 2. Currently, it has 9 registred students, this class is available for trial. If it has 10 registered student, this class is not available for trial.)
  
  `Register trial student number<= Class's Max student-Class's current students number`
   
   if `Class's trail Max student number` not 0,  `Register trial student number<=Class's trail Max student number`
   
   Then this day is available
  
  ***Note***
  
  * Case 1
  
       **Painting Beginning Class** max student number is 10, max trial student number is 0, currently registered student number is 9. 
       
       Now Mark book a trail for this class.
       
       After several day later, Kevin book this class, so after Kevin registered, this class's currently registered student number is 10, it should not be booked trail class, but Mark booked trail class before.
       
       For this conflict, need to solve by school manually.
