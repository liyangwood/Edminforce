Following questions I am not sure:

1. Should we separate server code and client code to different package
My understand, we should do it.

  **Advantage**
 
 * Make our code more reusable 
 * Make our application more easy to be configured

 **Disadvantage**
 
 * Increas package number, if we didn't organizate well, increase the difficult of maintain package  - I think we can use name standard to improve this

2. How to extend a package? 
3. Should we make collections be a package?
  
  My answer is **Yes**.
  
  Currently, we have both mobile app and web app, and they are using same Database, so collections will be reuse both mobile app and web app, but maybe the server code is different, so I think we should make collections be a package, and one package has one collection. 
  


# Package based Architecture

You can think package is same with Modularity. So all the principles of Modularity, you can use it here.

## Why packages based? 

1. File load order. The load order of files is explicit when using packages. 
2. Code Organization(Modularity). With packages, organization of your code is more modular and coupling between components is reduced or eliminated completely.
	* Typically each feature has it's own package
	* Each feature is independent, you can remove a package and the application still works.
3. Dependency Management. 
4. Global namespace conflicts.
5. Customizations are easier.
6. Update. You can use `meteor update` to update your application

## Key Principles
1. Packages. "Packages for everything" and build small, very specific custom packages that do one thing very well 
2. Namespace
3. Transform Classes
4. Common Validation Logic
5. Behavior Pattern

**Note:**
1. For third party packages/libraries, you should specify version

## Folder Structure 

### Application Structure LIFT Principle

Structure your app such that you can `L`ocate your code quickly, `I`dentify the code at a glance, keep the `F`lattest structure you can, and `T`ry to stay DRY. The structure should follow these 4 basic guidelines.

*Why LIFT?*: Provides a consistent structure that scales well, is modular, and makes it easier to increase developer efficiency by finding code quickly. Another way to check your app structure is to ask yourself: How quickly can you open and work in all of the related files for a feature?

When I find my structure is not feeling comfortable, I go back and revisit these LIFT guidelines

1. `L`ocating our code is easy
2. `I`dentify code at a glance
3. `F`lat structure as long as we can
4. `T`ry to stay DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) or T-DRY

```
|-- packages/
		|-- edminforce/
		|-- edminforce-lib/
		|-- edminforce-core/
		|-- edminforce-common/
		|-- edminforce-collections-account/
		|-- edminforce-collections-classes/
		|-- edminforce-login/
		|-- edminforce-login-client/
		|-- edminforce-login-server/
		|-- edminforce-classes/
		|-- edminforce-classes-client/

		|-- edminforce-classses-register/
		|-- edminforce-classses-register-client/
		|-- edminforce-classses-register-server/
|-- edminforce-index/
```

1. `edminforce`: Set up our application and global namespace for this application
2. `edminforce-lib`: Include all common third party libraries
3. `edminforce-core`: Core function of your application. 
4. `edminforce-common`: Sharable function between packages
5. `edminforce-login`: The main package for edminforce module, code for both server and client, and this package will include `edminforce-login-client`(code just for client) and `edminforce-login-server`(code just for server).

## Folder Structure of Package

```
/edminforce-login/
	|-- package.js
	|-- startup.js	
	|-- README.md
	|-- tests/
	|-- i18n/
	|-- lib/
		|-- router.js
```

```
/edminforce-login-client/
	|-- package.js
	|-- startup.js	
	|-- README.md
	|-- tests/
	|-- i18n/
	|-- lib/
			|-- models/
			|-- views/
			|-- controllers/
			|-- lib/
			|-- less/
```

```
/edminforce-login-server/
	|-- package.js
	|-- startup.js	
	|-- README.md
	|-- tests/
	|-- i18n/
	|-- lib/
			|-- models/
			|-- views/
			|-- controllers/
			|-- lib/
			|-- less/
```

## Code Standards
### package name
Package folder name Format: `[app-prefix]-[parent package name]-[package name]`.

Package name: `[app-prefix]:[parent package name]-[package name]`

For examples:

1. Folder name: `edminforce-lib`, Package Name: `edminforce:lib`
2. Folder name: `edminforce-classes`, Package Name: `edminforce:classes`

### Namespace
Add one meaningful global namespace for your app(`MyApp`), and register other global value to this global namespace. And it should at least contains following properties:

1. `Collections`. Register all your collections to this property.
2. `VERSION`. Version of your application

For example:

`EdminForce`, `EdminForce.Collections`

#### Global value in package
The global value in package should have same format with package name. 

For example:

Package name `edminforce-home`, then the global namespace should be `EdminForce.Home`, and you can add your value to `EdminForce.Home`, like `EdminForce.Home.value`. The name following UpperCamelCase.
